BILL.PY FUCNTION
This Python code defines classes to calculate and report bill splits between flatmates.
Classes and Their Responsibilities:
Bill:
Represents a utility bill.
__init__(self, amount, period): Initializes a Bill object with the total amount of the bill and the period it covers (e.g., "March 2021").
Flatmate:
Represents a person living in the flat.
__init__(self, name, days_in_house): Initializes a Flatmate object with their name and the days_in_house they stayed during the bill period.
pays(self, Bill, flatmate2): This method calculates how much a specific flatmate (self) should pay for a given Bill, considering the days they and flatmate2 were in the house.
It calculates a weight based on the proportion of days self was in the house compared to the total days self and flatmate2 were in the house.
It then multiplies the Bill.amount by this weight to determine the amount self needs to pay.
Pdfreport:
Intended to generate a PDF report (currently a placeholder).
__init__(self, filename): Initializes a Pdfreport object with the desired filename for the report.
genrate(self, flatmate1, flatmate2, Bill): This method is meant to generate the PDF report, taking the two flatmates and the bill as input. As of now, it contains pass, meaning it does nothing.
Program Flow:
Object Instantiation:
A Bill object is created with an amount of 128 and a period of "March 2021".
Two Flatmate objects are created: john (20 days) and marry (25 days).
Bill Calculation:
john.pays(Bill=Bill, flatmate2=marry): Calculates how much John should pay.
John's days: 20
Marry's days: 25
Total relevant days: 20 + 25 = 45
John's weight: 20 / 45
John's payment: 128 * (20 / 45)
marry.pays(Bill=Bill, flatmate2=john): Calculates how much Marry should pay.
Marry's days: 25
John's days: 20
Total relevant days: 25 + 20 = 45
Marry's weight: 25 / 45
Marry's payment: 128 * (25 / 45)
Output:
The calculated payment amounts for John and Marry are printed to the console.
